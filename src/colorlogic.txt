Hot weather is from 12 -> 40 degrees || Different hues of red
Cold weather is from -20 -> 12 degrees || Different hues of blue

We need to code color canges based on these values
to make things simpler, we can elimnate one factor of the RGB and
fix one and we change only one value to change the hues of blue, or red

Hot color logic

(R,G,B) -> (Red,Green,Blue)
(R=255, G=Variable, B=0)
(R=255, G=0, B=0) => most temperature
(R=255, G=255, B=0) => lest temperature

T: 12 => 40
G: 255=> 0
ratio= 1- ((t - 12)/(40-12));
